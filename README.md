# k8s guestbook for ARM64

These yaml files will help you run the [k8s guestbook](https://web.archive.org/web/20240627185946/https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/guestbook/) on an ARM64 kubernetes cluster.

I have 3 Orange Pi Zero 3's running as a k3s cluster, no x86 or amd64. 

These yaml files contain the correct images to follow along with the official guide. The official guide uses images that are not compatible with ARM64.
